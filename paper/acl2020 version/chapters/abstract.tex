\begin{abstract}
Abstract goes here.  This is some filler text to give you an idea
of how the wrapping and margins work for the paper abstract.  You are free
to change whatever text you like here, so long as Daniel Cer thinks its cool.
That's what Casey would say, anyways - we want to make sure Dan is, like, so super comfortable and everything.
