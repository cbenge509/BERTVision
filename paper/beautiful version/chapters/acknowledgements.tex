We are incredibly thankful for the faculty and instructors of W266: \textit{Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning} for their guidance, patience, and detailed feedback over the course of this project. In particular, we call out special thanks to Daniel Cer, PhD and Joachim Rahmfeld, PhD without whom we would not have escaped the tangled maze of BERT hidden activations in time.
